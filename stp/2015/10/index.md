# Scottish Theorem Proving

<div id="subtitle">

7th October 2015, University of Dundee

</div>

The [Scottish Theorem Proving Seminar (STP)][STP] will take place on the 7th October, 2015 at the Queen Mother Building, [University of Dundee][Dundee] ([travel information](http://www.computing.dundee.ac.uk/about/travel-information))

For details of previous meetings, see the [STP homepage][STP].

## Invited speakers

### [Helle Hvid Hansen][Helle]

##### [Delft University of Technology][Delft], The Netherlands

**Coinductive specification of k-regular sequences**

*Abstract*

Streams over a set A together with the head and tail operations
are the standard representation of the final A × Id coalgebra. Perhaps less
known is the fact that streams also form a final A × Id^k coalgebra, that
is, a final deterministic automaton on a k-letter alphabet with output in
A. In this talk, I will show how this final deterministic automaton of
streams yields a coalgebraic characterisation of k-regular sequences,
together with coinductive specification formats in the form of behavioural
differential equations using the zip-operations.

(Joint work with Clemens Kupke, Jan Rutten and Joost Winter)

### [Henning Basold][Henning]

##### [Delft University of Technology][Delft], The Netherlands

**Well-definedness and Observational Equivalence for Inductive-Coinductive Programs**

### [Chris Warburton][Chris]

##### [University of Dundee][Dundee], Scotland

**Scaling Theory Exploration in Haskell**

*Abstract*

We investigate the **theory exploration** (TE)
paradigm for computer-assisted Mathematics and identify limitations and
improvements for current approaches. Unlike the theorem-proving paradigm,
which requires user-provided conjectures, TE performs an open-ended
search for theorems satisfying given criteria. We see promise in TE for
identifying new abstractions and connections in libraries of software
and proofs, but realising this potential requires more scalable
algorithms than presently used.

### [Charles Grellois][Charles]

##### [PPS][PPS] & [LIAFA labs][LIAFA], France

**Coinductive semantics of linear logic and higher-order model-checking**

*Abstract*

A common approach in verification, model-checking consists in computing
whether a given formula holds on an abstract model of interest.
Decidability is usually obtained by standard reasoning on finite graphs
overapproximating the behavior of programs.

The model-checking of functional programs requires however a careful
treatment of higher-order computation, which is a major hurdle to the
traditional abstraction of programs as finite graphs, and leads to the need
for semantic methods.

In this talk, we explain how linear logic provides models of computation
which can be very naturally extended to account for the model-checking
problem of properties of monadic second-order logic, mixing inductive and
coinductive specification, over infinite trees generated by the coinductive
parallel head rewriting of a term with recursion.

This is joint work with my PhD advisor Paul-André Melliès.

## Registration

There are no registration fees, but *we require all attendees to [register by following this link][register].*

We still have slots available, so please consider volunteering a talk. It can be published work, work in progress, or  an "idea" talk - the STP audience appreciates all flavours of talks! You can send talk details via the [registration form][register] or [via email][contact].

We particularly encourage PhD students and early-career researchers to present.
